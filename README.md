## Hello! I am Manjot Singh, an aspiring software developer studying Computer Science at UC Irvine. 
My passion revolves around collecting, transforming, and providing data that helps further society. When a creative idea pops up in my head the first thing I try to do is integrate it with software. I have developed several personal projects based on those ideas focusing on incorporating software into daily life essentials including food, medicine, shopping, and vehicles.

### Personal Projects
- [Grosearch](https://github.com/ManjotSingh18/Grosearch): A grocery search engine with a singular search that encompasses several grocers and displays products side-by-side for convenient comparison saving time, and money.
- [CarTelligence](https://github.com/ManjotSingh18/CarTelligence): An application for classifying vehicles by make, model, and year via a machine learning model trained on the Stanford Car Dataset with a goal of satisfying user curiosity.
- [Walmartify](https://github.com/ManjotSingh18/Walmartify): A data collection program used to generate spreadsheets based upon product prices specified within nearby Walmart stores to analyze price discrepancies.
- [Medisee](https://github.com/ManjotSingh18/Medisee): A program based around improving the transparency and accessibility of information pertaining to medications and their adverse effects by providing visualizations of cases from the FDA API.
